# Elegant Sass Things [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chrislopresto/elegant-sass-things.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chrislopresto/elegant-sass-things)

## Core Tenets

- All styles encapsulated in mixins that are unit tested
- All generated classes are opt-in and generated by the mixins
- Mixins can be used by consuming apps
- Generated class names will be configurable
- All modules are consumable independently
  - i.e. just use the grid, not the spacing
- Sensible defaults
  - Can be used as is out of the box with zero config
  - All overridable in consuming apps
  - e.g. hydrate grid config with your own breakpoints, which are then used in the generated media queries
- Zero external dependencies
  - configurable nature makes it easy for consuming apps to optionally carry other dependencies for certain modules or additional functionality

## Unit Testing

All functions and mixins unit tested by [Sassaby](https://github.com/ryanbahniuk/sassaby)

## Running Tests

  * `npm test` or `npm run test-watch`

## Inspiration

- [Flexbox Grid](http://flexboxgrid.com/) for a solid grid
- [Reflexbox](http://jxnblk.com/reflexbox/) for the grid debug mode
- [Gridilydidily](https://philippkuehn.github.io/gridilydidily/) for its overridable config
